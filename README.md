#  Why I chose **Disclosure** for my tribute project
When I first listened to one of disclosures mixes on radio 1, I was drawn in by their unique approach towards producing house/garage music. 

As a result it had led me to explore so many different genres/sub genres of music, attending different worldwide events and forging lifelong friendships along the way!

# What did I learn within this project
In this project I managed to improve on my knowledge of CSS positioning by implementing the use of flex for my **"Discography"** section used to display Disclosures Albums.

I had also learned how to use media queries to make my tribute page mobile responsive by preventing the elements on my page from overlapping on smaller resolution displays.
